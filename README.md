The game works by (if in possession) choosing to shoot/pass or (if not in possession) intercepting/blocking.

Although at first glance it should work on a 50-50 chance, the game includes a weighted random, where passing increases shooting accuracy, increasing incentive to pass and not blindly spam shoot. However, all passes have a 50% chance of being intercepted.

If the game isn't decided in normal time (15 turns), the player can go for extra-time (7 turns) and then penalties. 

Penalties work by the player can choosing which direction (out of 3) they'd like to shoot and also jump. There is a 66% chance theyll score, but only a 33% chance theyll save the opposition's penalty. Each team has 5 penalties respectively. If after 5 penalties, the game still isn't decided by 5 penalties, the player can choose to go for best of one penalty, where each team only has a single penalty.
